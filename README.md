=======

Repository of starting code for in-class assignment on September 3, 2015.

The goal is for class to clone repository, use as a local eclipse workspace for analysis by importing project for 3 class exercises. Deleting unneeded packages. Add JUnit tests to ATM in package edu.elon.test. Create a GitHub public repository under each students name and push the workspace to GitHub.
